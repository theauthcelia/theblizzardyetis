                The most important thing you can do to avoid getting lost, is to

              <p>
                Use navigation aids to plan and execute your adventure: (1)
                hardcopy topographic AND interpretive maps (2) compass (3)
                standalone GPS (4) smartphone (generally in that priority).
                Whether you need to use your smartphone to confirm your
                location, to report the location of an injured party, or to
                guide SAR to your location - if you do become lost - it is
                essential that you know how to activate and utilize the location
                services (aka “the GPS”) feature in your phone. Always remember,
                it is important to call early, there is no charge for rescue,
                and give as much details as possible to assist SAR crews.

              <p>
                Hiking requires physical preparation. Be physically fit to enjoy
                your activities. Stick to a turn around time, and leave enough
                time to get home without causing people to worry about you. Take
                the proper equipment and have a trip plan - even if you will be
                hiking for only a few hours on a local mountain.

                Maintain a positive mental attitude if you become lost. Being
                lost is not dangerous if you are prepared. Stay Where You Are.
                People who go on, after becoming lost, usually get further from
                the trail and further from people who are looking for them. Help
                will come.

          <h2>What are the 10 Essentials?</h2>
          <p>
            Even the best weather can change rapidly, and even the widest trail
            can be lost. It pays to take a little extra with you, just in case.
            This list is NOT exhaustive - it is just a start - add to this list
            according to the season and your route. Notice: Always tell a
            reliable person where you are going and when to expect you back,
            leave a detailed trip itinerary, and make sure you know your route
            and plan accordingly. The below list assumes you are already wearing
            appropriate footwear - hiking boots NOT runners. Runners are a
            terrible choice for hiking. You will slip and or sprain your ankle.
            Appropriate hiking clothing that is NON-COTTON, such as hiking
            pants, poly-pro shirt, poly-pro underwear, toque, and backpack. NSR
            recommends taking the following 10 Essentials: Just remember, these
            are not get out of jail free cards, electronics can fail, run out of
            batteries, or lose their signal. Telling someone where you are
            going, leaving a trip itinerary and bringing the other 9 essentials
            is critical to a safe outdoor excursion.

                Good quality compass with built in declination adjustment and
                both topographical and interpretive maps. we also recommend a
                GPS unit but only as an adjunct to compass and map. Most team
                members carry a Garmin 60 series GPS unit that has terrific
                reception in the trees.

              <p>
                We recommend you bring a cell phone with a fully charged
                battery. It is advisable to keep the phone turned off, and
                stored in a ziplock bag. This way, if you get into trouble your
                phone will be dry and have a full charge. Many people manage to
                call 911 initially but their phone dies before their location
                can be relayed, not a desirable situation.
