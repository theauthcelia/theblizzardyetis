                The most important thing you can do to avoid getting lost, is to
                plan your route and try to know where you are at all times.
              </h3>
              <p>
                Use navigation aids to plan and execute your adventure: (1)
                hardcopy topographic AND interpretive maps (2) compass (3)
                standalone GPS (4) smartphone (generally in that priority).
                Whether you need to use your smartphone to confirm your
                location, to report the location of an injured party, or to
                guide SAR to your location - if you do become lost - it is
                essential that you know how to activate and utilize the location
                services (aka “the GPS”) feature in your phone. Always remember,
                it is important to call early, there is no charge for rescue,
                and give as much details as possible to assist SAR crews.

                A note, left with a responsible person, explains your
                destination, the route (or runs) you are taking, who is with
                you, and your return time. If you do not return as planned, this
                person can give the accurate information to the police.

                Be ready to stay out overnight in a survival situation. It is
                quite likely that you may not be reported missing for many
                hours. Carry extra clothing, survival gear, and be mentally
                prepared to endure the night out.

                Weather can change fast! Pack an extra jacket, gloves, and some
                snacks to stay warm and energized if you're out longer than
                expected.

              <h3>Be Prepared For Your Chosen Hike</h3>
              <p>
                Hiking requires physical preparation. Be physically fit to enjoy
                your activities. Stick to a turn around time, and leave enough
                time to get home without causing people to worry about you. Take
                the proper equipment and have a trip plan - even if you will be
                hiking for only a few hours on a local mountain.

              <p>
                Maintain a positive mental attitude if you become lost. Being
                lost is not dangerous if you are prepared. Stay Where You Are.
                People who go on, after becoming lost, usually get further from
                the trail and further from people who are looking for them. Help
                will come.

              <p>
                Going downhill often leads to dangerous natural drainages. These
                drainages have the common features of very thick bush, steep
                cliffs, and waterfalls.

                Protect yourself from the elements. Be as comfortable as
                possible but when it is light make sure you are visible from the
                air and visible to searchers in helicopters or planes.
