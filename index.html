            What should I do if I get caught in an avalanche?
          </button>
          <div class="content-panel">
            If you're caught in an avalanche, try to: Move to the side of the
            avalanche path if possible. Drop heavy gear to stay light and
            mobile. Use swimming motions to stay on top of the snow. Create
            space to breathe by placing an arm in front of your face. If you're
            buried, try to remain calm, conserve air, and stay still to preserve
            energy.

          </button>
          <div class="content-panel">
            To reduce your risk of getting caught in an avalanche: Check local
            avalanche forecasts before heading out. Avoid steep slopes
            (especially those between 30° and 45°) after heavy snowfall or wind.
            Travel with experienced partners and keep proper spacing between
            group members. Always carry essential safety gear: avalanche beacon,
            probe, and shovel. Take an avalanche safety course to learn how to
            recognize hazards and make safer decisions in the backcountry.

            Signs of hypothermia include shivering, slurred speech, slow
            breathing, confusion, clumsiness, and drowsiness. In severe cases, a
            person may stop shivering and lose consciousness.

            Stay dry, wear layered clothing, and avoid sweating. If you get wet,
            change into dry clothes immediately. Keep your head, hands, and feet
            warm, and take regular breaks to avoid exhaustion. Always carry
            extra warm clothing in cold conditions.

            Get the person to a warm, dry place. Remove wet clothing and replace
            it with dry, warm layers. Provide warm (non-alcoholic,
            non-caffeinated) drinks and blankets. Seek medical help immediately
            if symptoms are severe. Avoid rapid warming methods like hot water,
            as they can cause shock.
